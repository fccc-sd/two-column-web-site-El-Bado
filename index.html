            <h3>My Family</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                My family and I are pretty close my mother has never
                been married to my biological father and I go to see
                him every other weekend also I am very close to my
                step-dad. My grandfather on my mothers side passed
                away five years ago and my grandfather on my dads side has
                stage three bone cancer currently. My grandma practically
                raised me for the first few years because of my
                mother's age.
            </p>

            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                I was born in Lima Ohio
                and raised in<strong> Defiance Ohio</strong>. <br>
                I have lived in multiple states throuout my life including
                Ohio,Texas,North Carolina,and Kentucky.Three of those states
                were because of my step-dads military orders.
                I have lived in Ohio for the longest out of all of them
                this is the list of what I think is the list longest
                to shortest lived.
